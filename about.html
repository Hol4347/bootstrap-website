<h4>Company's History</h4>
<p>Our company was founded in 2021 by Riley Holsinger, Paige Livingston and Emmalie Hardacre in a college campus called Waynesburg University.</p>
<p>The company was started after the three students got thrown into a group project by the one and only Doctor (Doc) Chad Sherman. These students knew how affectionate Doc was towards the shoes that were the greatest of all time in his opinion.</p>
<p>The students wanted to start a brand new company up in honor of his love of Crocs. Individually, all three students created a website to commemorate Doc's love of Crocs and decided on selling some of his favorite pairs of Crocs to others around the world to enjoy!</p>
<p>In making a purchase on Doc's Crocs, you will donate to Doc's retirement fund so he can live out the rest of his life enjoying to walk around in the stylish shoe. As seen in the progress bar below, we are 75% on the way to financially supporting Doc's retirement fund! You can contribute to the cause by buying a pair today!</p>
